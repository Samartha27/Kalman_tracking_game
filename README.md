# Kalman_tracking_game


This repository performs detection and object tracking of a ball jumping around in a plane with the help of Kalman estimation. 

## Implementation
`python object_tracking.py --input_dir`


## Sample output:
Detected Centers :  [[297.75], [150.5]] \
Kalman a priori =  [[293.0], [136.875]] \
Kalman estimation =  [[295.0], [142.0]]
